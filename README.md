# Makeup-Randomizers
Eyeshadow randomizer: Chooses your eyeshadow palette, colors, eyeshadow look, and eyeliner style. I only added three palettes because those are the only palettes I own currently, and I also added some basic eyeshadow looks. More will be added as I collect more palettes and get better at eyeshadow. I'm also looking into creating an API or database of some sort for this program. (UPDATE: The Morphe 9Q Love Matters Palette has been added) \
\
Graphic Eyeliner randomizer: Chooses the shades, colors, and style of eyeliner. Shades are based on Gavissi Beauty Colour Galaxy, Neon, and Pastel Palettes (highly recommend). (UPDATE: You can now decide how many palettes you want to choose from.)\

More to come soon.
