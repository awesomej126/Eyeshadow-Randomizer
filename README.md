# Makeup-Randomizers
Eyeshadow randomizer: Chooses your eyeshadow palette, colors, eyeshadow look, and eyeliner style. I only added three palettes because those are the only palettes I own currently, and I also added some basic eyeshadow looks. More will most likely be added soon as I collect more palettes and get better at eyeshadow.\

Graphic Eyeliner randomizer: Chooses the shades, colors, and style of eyeliner. Shades are based on Gavissi Beauty Colour Galaxy, Neon, and Pastel Palettes (highly recommend). (UPDATE: You can now decide how many palettes you want to choose from. This is a beta version of what I hope to be an updated, more efficient version of my terrible code.)\

More to come soon.
