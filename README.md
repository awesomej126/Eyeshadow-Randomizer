# Makeup-Randomizers
Eyeshadow palette randomizer: Chooses your eyeshadow palette, colors, eyeshadow look, and eyeliner style. I only added three palettes because those are the only palettes I own currently, and I also added some basic eyeshadow looks. More will be added as I collect more palettes and get better at eyeshadow. I'm also looking into creating a feature that allows users to input their own eyeshadow palettes for this program. (UPDATE: The Morphe 9Q Love Matters Palette has been added) \
\
Graphic Eyeliner palette randomizer: User inputs the number of palettes they want out of three. Randomizer chooses the shades, colors, and style of eyeliner. Shades are based on Gavissi Beauty Colour Galaxy, Neon, and Pastel Palettes (highly recommend). (UPDATE: I created an alternate verison of the program where the user clicks on the button associated with the number of palettes they want to use.)\

More to come soon.
